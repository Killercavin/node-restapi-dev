## Disclamer

- The programs and CRUD operations that results to login, delete user, update user did not pass. Only the register user passed. For this reason, feel free to contribute and bring your suggestion without fear.
- You can alter the code base as you wish there is not restriction. Thanks, Happy Coding!
